# HODL Gallop

HODL Gallop is a crypto market simulator in the theme of a horse race.
Each horse is representing a different crypto token. When you bet on a horse it's price goes up.
You can sell your tickets at any point for a profit.

## How to Play

1. You bet on a horse that you like
2. You shill that horse to other players
3. You sell your bet for a profit once they invested

## Details

- Selling your tickets will make the price go down again.
- The price follows a square root pattern, more wager is needed to get more tickets.
- The race never ends, just like the crypto market. There is only temporary winners, whose price went up the most recently.
- There is no fee to play, other than transaction fees. It's actually more efficient than gambling on a CEX.
- Your tickets remain within the smart contract. Your wallet is the key to sell / transfer them.
- The game is a parody on fixed supply crypto tokens, showing how they are just a ponzi to be gambled with.
- You can have the same fun betting on these horses than trading the actual tokens.
- Avoid buying / selling large quantities in one go, due to internal slippage.
